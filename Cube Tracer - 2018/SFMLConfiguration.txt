	BEGIN:

	Open the "Solution Explorer" Tab on the right hand side of screen.

	Right Click on the "CUBE TRACER" Project File (not Solution 'Cube Tracer')

	Go to Properties
	
	Ensure your Configuration settings at the top left-hand side of the properties window is set to "All Configurations"
	
	On the left hand side there are multiple tabs, click on "VC++ Directories"

	in "VC++ Directories" find "Include Directories" click on it, then click on the drop down arrow on the right 

	Select <Edit..>

	Click on the red colored X to clear the previous path then click on the folder* icon and the "..." to open file explorer

	The file explorer should already open within our project file

	Look at the file path and backtrack once into "DK - CUBE TRACER" to get into the main project folder

	You should see a folder called "sfml"

	click on "sfml" and within the folder you should see another folder called "include"

	Select "include then click "Select Folder", click "ok" then "apply"

	Now we need to add our "lib" folder by repeating our same pathing process we did for include

	Still within the VC++ tab, a little further down we should see "Library Directories"

	Click on it and repeat the same process.. Click on edit, delete previous pathing, click on folder* and "..."

	When the File explorer opens the project file, just click back again on the filepath and find the same "sfml" folder

	click on it, and this time instead off adding the "include" folder, we are adding the "lib" folder

	select the "lib" folder, hit ok, then apply.

	Next click on the "C++" tab located on the left and Under "VC++ Directories"
	
	This time you'll notice a drop down section.. We want to click on the first, "General"

	Ensure, just like previously, that Configuration on the top left is set to "All Configurations" 

	Within General we are going to repeat the process we just did, and add the "include" library again.

	Click on "Additional Include Directories" and repeat the same folder routing process

	once the "include" folder from "sfml" has been selected, hit ok and apply.

	Last but  not least we need to add the entire sfml folder somewhere

	click on the "Linker" tab located on the left and Under "C++"

	We want to click on "General"

	Within General find "Adittional Library Directories"

	Click on this and repeat the process done throughout this walkthrough

	However this time, rather than opening the sfml file and clicking on a folder like "include" or lib"

	Just select the entire sfml folder

	Once you've selected the entire sfml folder, hit ok then apply

	You have now linked everything to compile the program within Visual Studio.

	If there are any errors existing check your pathing and outsource to other options of configuration.
